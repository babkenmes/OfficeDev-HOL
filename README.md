# Office and Office 365 Hands-on Labs #

This repository contains multiple hands-on labs for Office and Office 365 development. The objective is to get familiar with the different possibilities within this exciting new development space.

These hands-on labs are perfect for anyone interested in getting started developing Office add-ins and calling the Office 365 REST APIs (including the Microsoft Graph). In addition, more advanced topics are also included - such as building single sign-on experiences with an Outlook add-in.

Short of time and just want the final sample? Clone this repository (```git clone https://github.com/simonjaeger/OfficeDev-HOL.git```) and browse the completed solution files.
