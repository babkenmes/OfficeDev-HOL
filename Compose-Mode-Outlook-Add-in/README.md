With the new application model for Office comes a brand new way of extending Office with your own functionality - using the tools and dev stacks that we already know and love. 

This hands-on lab demonstrates a few different ways to interact with the Office context.  Setting different properties of a mailbox item (message or appointment) in compose mode. In addition, different styles and components from the Office UI Fabric library is used throughout this Office add-in. 
The objective is to get familiar with some of the possiblities that we have when building Excel add-ins.

The hands-on lab is divided into multiple exercises and should be followed in a chronological order. These are the included exercises:

* [1.1 Create the project](#exercise-11-create-the-project)
* [1.2 Edit the manifest](#exercise-12-edit-the-manifest)
* [1.3 Launch the project](#exercise-13-launch-the-project)
* [2.1 Clean up the project](#exercise-21-clean-up-the-project)
* [2.2 Add Office UI Fabric](#exercise-22-add-office-ui-fabric)
* [2.3 Add the base](#exercise-23-add-the-base-css--html)
